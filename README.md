# Medical Dataset Analysis: Python, SQL, and Insights · Jan 2024

  The primary goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of healthcare data, aiming to uncover valuable insights that have the potential to revolutionize decision-making in healthcare and optimize resource allocation for the betterment of patients' lives. 
  The project centers around three crucial datasets: "hospitalization_details," "medical_examinations," and "names." It is structured into three key modules, with the initial phase dedicated to thorough data cleaning to ensure accuracy and proper structure. Once the data is refined, the second module leverages the power of SQL queries to extract meaningful and actionable insights. 
  The third module takes a step further by visualizing the data through a meaningful and interactive Power BI Dashboard. This visualization not only facilitates a better understanding of the insights but also provides a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to interact with the data. This multi-faceted approach aims to make a substantial impact on healthcare decision-making and resource optimization, ultimately leading to positive outcomes for patients and the healthcare system as a whole.

### Summary of my work:
• Enhanced healthcare decisions through Python and SQL data analytics.

• Meticulously cleaned data to ensure accuracy of critical medical datasets.

• Utilized SQL queries to extract crucial insights from patients' medical history and hospitalization details for informed decision-making.

• Analysis revealed that the rise in health awareness over the years has led to an increase in routine checkups, yet some patients without significant health issues or surgeries are being charged substantial amounts, prompting the need for further investigation.

• Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for insightful data visualization and informed decision-making.
