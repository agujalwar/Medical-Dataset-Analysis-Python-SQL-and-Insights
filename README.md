# Medical Dataset Analysis: Python, SQL, and Insights · Jan 2024

This project focuses on three critical datasets: "hospitalization_details," "medical_examinations," and "names." Divided into two essential modules, the project commences with meticulous data cleaning, ensuring the data's accuracy and structure. Once the data shines brilliantly, the second module unleashes the power of SQL queries to extract valuable insights.

### Summary of my work:
• Enhanced healthcare decisions through Python and SQL data analytics.

• Meticulously cleaned data to ensure accuracy of critical medical datasets.

• Utilized SQL queries to extract crucial insights from patients' medical history and hospitalization details for informed decision-making.

• Analysis revealed that the rise in health awareness over the years has led to an increase in routine checkups, yet some patients without significant health issues or surgeries are being charged substantial amounts, prompting the need for further investigation.

• Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for insightful data visualization and informed decision-making.
